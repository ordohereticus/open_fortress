It's not every day that mercenaries have to deal with scheduling conflicts, but that's exactly what's happened here at Mulholland Studios in sunny California.

Another client wants them intimidated into silence because "their guitar solos suck ass". But the two separately hired enforcers have no intention of working together - with mere hours to go before the band arrives for a recording session, only one merc is winning this post-hippie punchup.
